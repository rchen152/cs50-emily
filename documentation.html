      Emily is a chatbot that lives at <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily/cgi/emily.cgi">http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily/cgi/emily.cgi</a> and can also be reached, more conveniently, at <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily">http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily</a>.  A  visitor talks to her by typing a comment in the textbox in the bottom left corner of the  screen and pressing Enter.  If the cursor is not in the textbox, refreshing the page should fix  the problem.  The developing conversation will appear in the text area directly under the word 'Emily' on the left side of the screen.
      <br /><br />
      The picture of Emily on the right side of the screen links to a second page, <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily/cgi/brain.cgi">http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily/cgi/brain.cgi</a> on which the visitor can teach Emily what to say in response to certain comments.  The teaching works in a conversation format in which the visitor talks to Emily in the same way as on the home page, except that when Emily encounters something she does not know how to answer, rather than guessing she waits for the user to input a response that she will memorize and use in the future.  These instructions are also in the top right corner of the screen.
      <br /><br />
      For the visitor's convenience, below the instructions is a list of responses Emily has in memory.  When it is the visitor's turn in the conversation, this list shows all of the visitor comments that Emily has received in the past, with the most relevant ones first.  Similarly, when the visitor is prompted to enter a response that Emily will use, there will be displayed all of the responses that Emily has been taught in the past.  Clicking the word 'Emily' in the top left corner takes the visitor back to the first page.
      <br /><br />
      As a tool against malicious/immature visitors, there is also an administrator page, requiring password authentication, located at <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily/cgi/admin.cgi">http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily/cgi/admin.cgi</a>.  On this page, an administrator can browse through Emily's memory, with the most recently learned responses shown first, and delete anything objectionable.  For security reasons, access information for the administrator page is in the design document.
      <br /><br />
      Finally, this documentation resides at <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily/documentation.html">http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-emily/documentation.html</a>.
